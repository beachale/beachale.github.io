# MC-Texture-to-MERS tool - Vibecoded using Chat GPT 5 and Claude AI (Opus, Sonnet)
Converts a Minecraft texture to a MERS .tga with modifiable RGBA values for Vibrant Visuals.

https://beachale.github.io/

Has many features:
Can optionally load a vanilla mers and map the values onto the mers you're creating.
Does not fully support upscaled textures like intended. Coming soon.
Can edit each rgba channel and preview them in either color or grayscale for better contrast visualization.
Animate textures with several frames e.g. portal texture, with frame speed and frame size settings.
Add noise to the mers tga. Both of the noise generators does the same thing.

Has sliders, curves, paint tools and color select with fill for each channel with undo and redo options, and a color picker which can colorpick transparent pixels.

Third-party component:
JSZip - used to export individual channels as .png
